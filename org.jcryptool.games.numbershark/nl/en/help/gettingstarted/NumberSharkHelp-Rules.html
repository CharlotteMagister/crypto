<h1>Rules</h1>

<h4>Goal:</h4>
<p>You win, if the sum of your numbers is larger than the sum of the Number Shark numbers.
Try to maximize your sum as much as you can.</p>

<h4>Rules:</h4>
<p>You always have the first turn.</p>
  
<p>Select an arbitrary number from the number selection area.
The Number Shark eats any real divisor of the selected number, as long as the divisor has not been eaten up before
(e.g. 6 has the real divisors 1, 2, 3).
Continue selecting numbers, which have not been selected before or were eaten by the Number Shark in previous rounds.
Pay attention, the Number Shark always needs a number.
If you select a number without remaining free divisors, then the Number Shark will take this number and you will get nothing.
The game is over with the selection of the last free number.</p>

<h1>Tutorial</h1>

<p>The Number Shark game is a tool to learn more about divisors and
prime numbers. The tutorial is based on a number set from 1 to 20
(the number set can be changed by starting a new game). The
game seems to be easy for a small number set, but is rather challenging
for a huge number set.

<h4>1. The idea of the game</h4>

<p>The idea of the game is to win as many numbers as possible from a
given number set. The sum or score of the numbers should be larger than
the sum of the Number Shark numbers and as close as possible to the
maximum sum or optimal score of the number set. After selecting one
number, the Number Shark eats all free, real divisors of the number
(e.g. all real divisors of 6 are 1, 2 and 3). The game is over after
all numbers have been selected or have been eaten by the Number Shark.</p>

<h4>2. The first move</h4>

<p>In this tutorial, the number set is
set to 20, to set up the game to a playing field size of 20, click on &quot;New game&quot; and enter 20. The Number Shark eats all free, real divisors
of your selected number. The number itself is eaten by the Number Shark,
if the selected number has no free, real divisors any more. So try to
minimise the numbers eaten by the Number Shark to 1 or 2. To get an optimal
score, always select the largest available prime number as first number ,
thus here the 19. The largest prime number has only the 1 as free, real
divisor. You can select the number 19 in the number set selection area.</p>

<p>Thus after selecting the 19, the Number Shark eats the 1. After
selecting the 19, the 19 and 1 will be coloured in gray. Both numbers are now out of the game and neither
active nor free any more.</p>
<p>The info area and info window documents your move course. Beside the number of
  your step, your selected number, your current score as well as the
  numbers of the Number Shark and his current score will be recorded. At the
  bottom you can see at a glance your move course. In addition you have information about the
  total sum of the number set numbers and the minimum sum, which must be
  reached to win the game. Furthermore, your and the Number Shark current
scores are emphasised.</p>
<p>During the move course it could happen, that numbers stay without
  free, real divisors and are no divisors for other free numbers.
  These numbers cannot contribute to your score any more. If such a
  situation occurs the button "Shark meal" will be activated. By clicking that button, all these numbers will directly be added to the points to the shark(and won't be active anymore).  It is recommended to push the button after it has been
activated. You gain a better overview for all interesting numbers. The following image shows the game after the button &quot;Shark meal&quot;(</img><img src="Tutorial_Haifutter.JPG"

<h4>3. Further moves</h4>

<p>After the first move, the selection for the next moves will be
more difficult. You should try to leave as less numbers as possible for the Number Shark. Best is only 1 divisor, in some cases also 2 divisors.
But don't select too small numbers, which may have only one divisor,
because they are needed as divisors for larger numbers. For the second
move it is recommended to select either 15=3*5, 14=2*7 or 10=2*5. The
window below shows the situation after pushing the 15.</p>

  <br>
  To support you for the next decision, stay on the number 10 for a second and a tooltip will be viewed. There, you can read which active divisors the number 10 still got. For the number 10, in our case, just the number 2 is an active divisor. We will choose this number as our next move.

  You can get more hints by clicking on the button
"Hint"<img src="Tutorial_Hinweis.JPG"
	alt="Hint button"> in the toolbar. The hint recommends you to take the number 20. We will follow the recommendation and press &quot;Yes&quot;. This hint will always give a hint, which number is necessary to reach the optimal score, thus in some cases it is not possible to give a hint and the button is deactivated.</p>

<p><br>
  For the next three moves you can select the free numbers 16, 12 and 14 in an arbitrary order. All numbers have only one divisor left and all
  free divisors are different. If you would like to revise your decision
after pushing e.g. the 12, press the button "Undo".</p>
<p>In the following image the numbers 14, 12 and 16 were chosen.</p>

<p>The last remaining numbers are 18 and 9, press 18 and the game is over. Congratulations, you won the game, we even reached an optimal score. The numbers 16, 14 and 12 could be chosen in an arbitrary order, so you see the move sequence is not unique. <br>
  A dialog appears proposing you to save the course of the game to a 
  log-file(.csv). The table in the lower part of the view will be exported and can be opened e.g. in Excel.</p>

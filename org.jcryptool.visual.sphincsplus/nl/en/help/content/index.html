	<h1>The SPHINCS+ signature (and how to use the plugin)</h1>
	<p>
		SPHINCS+ is a stateless, hash-based signature method that is
		considered to be quantum computer resistant. As of June 2019, it is
		called "Digital Signature Algorithm" in the 2nd round of the NIST
		Competition <a
			href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Post-Quantum-Cryptography/Round-2-Submissions">
			"Post-Quantum Cryptography"</a>.</p>
	<p>The JCT online help about SPHINCS+ is divided into three parts:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><a href="index.html">Using the plugin</a></li>
	<li><a href="algorithm.html">Algorithm </a></li>
	<li><a href="ablauf.html">Process/scheme </a></li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Calling the plugin </h3>
		<p>The plugin can be opened via the main menu entry "Visualization" and the
			menu item "SPHINCS+ signature". Then a tab appears "SPHINCS+
			signature", which has 4 sub-tabs. These are: </p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="#params"> Parameter Description </a></li>
			<li><a href="#signing"> Signing and Verification </a></li>
			<li><a href="#hypertree"> SPHINCS+ Hypertree </a></li>
			<li><a href="#forstree"> SPHINCS+ FORS </a></li>
		</ul>

	<h3 id="params">Parameters and key generation</h3>

		<h4 id="Parameter">Parameters section</h4>
		<p>In the first sub-tab you can modify and view the following parameters of the procedure.</p>
		<table border=1>
			<Thead>
				<Tr>
					<td>parameters</td>
					<td>Description</td>
				</Tr>
			<Tbody>
				<Tr>
					<td>General</td>
					<td>The parameters are given in base decimal 10 system.</td>
				<Tr>
					<td>Security</td>
					<td>The procedure defines parameter sets for those below
						following parameters.<br> The naming scheme of parameter
						sets is: SPHINCS<sup>+</sup> security level {s, f}. The desired
						Security can take the following values: 128, 192, 256 bit
						Security. <br> The last part of the naming scheme {s, f}
						returns whether the method is based on speed (f, fast) or size of
						Signature (s, size) should be optimized.<br> The parameters
						of Sets were chosen in the standard so that a reasonable
						Relationship between speed and signature size is present.<br>
						In the second combo box you choose which one Hash method is used.</td>
				</Tr>
				<Tr>
					<td>parameter n</td>
					<td>The safety parameter of the procedure. The signature is be
						a multiple of n. The parameter defines the output length all
						cryptographic functions except H<sub>msg</sub>.</td>
				</Tr>
				<Tr>
					<td>parameter h</td>
					<td>The parameter h indicates the height of the hypertree, and
					thus the number of FORS instances.<br>
					The bigger the parameter The more unlikely it is that a FORS key
					pair is used several times. The process is safer, but it is growing
					thus the height of the hypertree and thus the signature length.</td>
				</Tr>
				<Tr>
					<td>parameter d</td>
					<td>The parameter d can be used to set the speed of the
						Influence the procedure. He defines the number of levels in the
						XMSS trees in hypertree. As a result, parameter d must have the
						parameter h divide. <br> The larger d is, the smaller are the
						subtrees and the faster it can be signed. However, d also defines
						the number of WOTS + signatures in a hypertree, and so too in the
						resulting signature.</td>
				</Tr>
				<Tr>
					<td>parameter log (t) or a</td>
					<td>The parameter a is calculated from the logarithm dualis
						from t. The parameter t defines the number of leaves in one FORS
						tree. He must be a multiple of 2.<br> A little one t leads
						to smaller and faster signatures, but needed a predefined security
						level thus a larger parameter k.</td>
				</Tr>
				<Tr>
					<td>parameter k</td>
					<td>The k parameter is related to the t parameter. This 2
						Parameters define the speed and safety of FORS.</Td>
				</Tr>
				<Tr>
					<td>parameter w</td>
					<td>The Winternitz parameter w defines the number and length
						the hash chains per WOTS<sup>+ </sup> instance. <br> A bigger
						one Value leads to a linearly longer length of the chains, but to
						a logarithmic-reduced number. A large value w leads to shorter
						signatures, however, will be at the expense of speed
						(exponentially!).</td>
				</Tr>
				<Tr>
					<Td>BitSec</td>
					<td>Bitsec is the pre-calculated security of the used one
						Parameters.</td>
				</Tr>
				<Tr>
					<td>sec level</td>
					<td>The security level of the parameters used.</td>
				</Tr>
				<tr>
					<td>sig bytes</td>
					<td>Length of the signature in bytes.</td>
				</tr>
				<Tr>
					<Td>RANDOMIZE</td>
					<td>Randomize sets a random value as Seed for the pseudorandom
						permutation, which in the Creating the SPHINCS+ signature is
						used.</td>
				</tr>
				<Tr>
					<td>Checkbox "Manual Parameter Input"</td>
					<td>If this checkbox is activated, parameters can be set
						outside the predefined parameter sets. there however, the fields
						"bitsec", "sec level" and "sig bytes" disabled because these
						values ​​can differ greatly.</td>
				</Tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Generate key button</td>
					<td>With the push of a button, a SPHINCS+ key pair is generated. The key pair is displayed in the underlying Section.</td>
				</tr>

		</Table>

		<h4>Secret-key component section</h4>
		<p>The display of the keys can be made by the switching button
			between "Hex" (hexadecimal) and "base64" are changed.</p>
		<p>With the checkbox "Manual seed input" the seed can be handled
			manually be entered. This allows signatures to be reproduced.</p>
		<p>The secret key consists of 4 n-sized parts. In the graphic
			surface, these parts are displayed individually. The abbreviation
			"SK" stands for "Secret Key" (private key) and "PK" for "public key".</p>
		<table border=1>

				<td>component</td>
				<td>Use</td>

			<Tbody>
				<Tr>
					<td>SK.seed</td>
					<td>The initialization vector SK.seed is being created all
						secret keys used by WOTS<sup>+</sup> and FORS. He is the secret
						key of the hypertree.</td>

					<Td>SK.prf</td>

		</Table>

		<h4>Public-key component section</h4>
		<p>The public key contains 2 fields from the secret key: PK.seed
			and PK.root.</p>


		<h3 id="signing">Signing and verification</h3>
		
		<h4>Message section</h4>
		<p>Here you can see your message, which should be signed enter.</p>
		<h4>Sign and Verify section</h4>
		<p>You can use the "Sign message" button above enter sign message.
			This functionality only works then, if in the tab "parameters and key
			generation" key were generated.</p>
		<p>You can already use the Verify Signature button Verify created
			signature. Should you have no message yet an error message is
			displayed.</p>
		<p>The status display shows you the current status.</p>

		<h4>Character representation</h4>
		<p>With this button you can choose between the hexadecimal and
			choose the base64 representation.</p>

		<h4>Signature values</h4>
		<p>A SPHINCS+ signature consists of 3 parts that are in the
			graphical interface.</p>
		<p>These values are the random value "R", the signature part
			generated by FORS, and the signature part generated from the hypertree.</p>

		<h3 id="hypertree">SPHINCS+ hypertree</h3>
		<p>In the upper section is a description and a dynamic text field.
			The dynamic text box adapts, depending after which element in the
			underlying representation was selected.<p>
		<p>The graphical representation should show a tree in which every
			node (except the root) represents a tree again. The XMSS trees are
			displayed as an orange, fold-out box. The root node (public key) of
			each XMSS tree is included used as a node of the hypertree.</p>
		<p>The leaves of Hypertree are FORS trees. Click on it If you jump
			one tab on the fourth tab of the plugin.</p>

		<h3 id="forest">SPHINCS+ FORS</h3>
		<p>The public key of the FORS tree is called a leaf in the
			hypertree used. The FORS tree again consists of subtrees. These
			subtrees are displayed as a drop-down item. there the root and the
			container element are marked in green &ndash; they represent the same
			element.</p>

</head>
<body>
	<h1>The SPHINCS + signature method</h1>
	<P>
		SPHINCS + is a stateless, hash based method Signature method that is
		considered to be quantum computer resistant. As of June In 2019 it is
		called "Digital Signature Algorithm" in the 2nd round of the NIST
		Competition <a
			href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Porjects/Post-Quantum-Cryptography/Round-2-Submissions">
			"Post-Quantum Cryptography "</a> The documentation is divided into three
		parts:
	</p>
	<li><a href="index.html">plugin description </a></li>
	<li><a href="algorithm.html">Algorithm </a></li>
	<li><a href="ablauf.html">the process </a></li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Calling the plugin </h3>
		<p>The plugin is opened via the main menu "Visualization" and the
			Start menu item "SPHINCS + signature". Then a tab appears "Signature+
			signature", which has 4 sub-tabs. These are: </p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="#params"> Parameter Description </a></li>
			<li><a href="#signing"> Signing and Verification </a></li>
			<li><a href="#hypertree"> SPHINCS + Hypertree </a></li>
			<li><a href="#forstree"> SPHINCS + FORS </a></li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="params">Parameters and key generation</h3>
		<h4 id="Parameter">Parameters section</h4>
		<p>In this overview you can see the parameters that the procedure
			used, modify and view.

				<Tr>
					<Td>parameters</td>
					<Td>Description</td>
				</Tr>
			<Tbody>
				<Tr>
					<Td>General</td>
					<td>The parameters are given in base decimal 10 system.</td>
				<Tr>
					<Td>Security</td>
					<td>The procedure defines parameter sets for those below
						following parameters. <br> The naming scheme of parameter
						sets is: SPHINCS<sup>+</sup> security level {s, f}. The desired
						Security can take the following values: 128, 192, 256 bit
						Security. <br> The last part of the naming scheme {s, f}
						returns whether the method is based on speed (f, fast) or size of
						Signature (s, size) should be optimized. <br> The parameters
						of Sets were chosen in the standard so that a reasonable
						Relationship between speed and signature size is present. <br>
						In the second combo box you choose which one Hash method is used.
					</Td>
				</Tr>
				<Tr>
					<td>parameter n</td>
					<td>The safety parameter of the procedure. The signature is be
						a multiple of n. The parameter defines the output length all
						cryptographic functions except H <sub> msg </sub>.
					</Td>
				</Tr>
				<Tr>
					<td>parameter h</td>
					<h> The parameter h indicates the height of the hypertree, and
					thus the number of FORS instances. <br>
					The bigger the parameter The more unlikely it is that a FORS key
					pair is used several times. The process is safer, but it is growing
					thus the height of the hypertree and thus the signature length.
					</Td>
				</Tr>
				<Tr>
					<td>parameter d</td>
					<td>The parameter d can be used to set the speed of the
						Influence the procedure. He defines the number of levels in the
						XMSS trees in hypertree. As a result, parameter d must have the
						parameter h divide. <br> The larger d is, the smaller are the
						subtrees and the faster it can be signed. However, d also defines
						the number of WOTS + signatures in a hypertree, and so too in the
						resulting signature.
					</Td>
				</Tr>
				<Tr>
					<td>Parameter log (t) or a</td>
					<td>The parameter a is calculated from the logarithm dualis
						from t. The parameter t defines the number of leaves in one FORS
						tree. He must be a multiple of 2. <br> A little one t leads
						to smaller and faster signatures, but needed a predefined security
						level thus a larger parameter k.
					</Td>
				</Tr>
				<Tr>
					<td>parameter k</td>
					<td>The k parameter is related to the t parameter. This 2
						Parameters define the speed and safety of FORS.</Td>
				</Tr>
				<Tr>
					<td>parameter w</td>
					<td>The Winternitz parameter w defines the number and length
						the hash chains per WOTS<sup>+ </sup> instance. <br> A bigger
						one Value leads to a linearly longer length of the chains, but to
						a logarithmic-reduced number. A large value w leads to shorter
						signatures, however, will be at the expense of speed
						(Exponentially!).
					</Td>
				</Tr>
				<Tr>
					<Td>BitSec</td>
					<td>Bitsec is the precalculated security of the used one
						Parameters.</Td>
				</Tr>
				<Tr>
					<td>sec level</td>
					<td>The security level of the parameters used.</td>
				</Tr>
				<tr>
					<td>sig bytes</td>
					<td>Länge der Signatur in Bytes.</td>
				</tr>
				<Tr>
					<Td>RANDOMIZE</td>
					<td>Randomize sets a random value as Seed for the pseudorandom
						permutation, which in the Creating the SPHINCS + signature is
						used.
				<Tr>
					<td>Checkbox "Manual Parameter Input"</td>
					<td>If this checkbox is activated, parameters can be set
						outside the predefined parameter sets. there however, the fields
						"bitsec", "sec level" and "sig bytes" disabled because these
						values ​​can differ greatly.</td>

		<h4>Secret-Key component section</h4>
		<p>The display of the keys can be made by the switching button
			between "Hex" (hexadecimal) and "base64" are changed.</P>
		<p>With the checkbox "Manual seed input" the seed can be handled
			manually be entered. This allows signatures to be reproduced.</P>
		<p>The secret key consists of 4 n-sized parts. In the graphic
			surface, these parts are displayed individually. The Abbreviation
			"SK" stands for "Secret Key" (private key) and "PK" for "public key".

		<h4>Public-key component section</h4>
		<p>The public key contains 2 fields from the secret key: PK.seed
			and PK.root.</P>

		<h3 id="signing">Signing and verification</h3>
		<h4>Message section</h4>
		<p>Here you can see your message, which should be signed enter.</p>
		<h4>Sign and Verify section</h4>
		<p>You can use the "Sign message" button above enter sign message.
			This functionality only works then, if in the tab "parameters and key
			generation" key were generated.</p>
		<p>You can already use the Verify Signature button Verify created
			signature. Should you have no message yet an error message is
			displayed.</p>
		<p>The status display shows you the current status.</p>
		<H4>character representation</h4>
		<p>With this button you can choose between the hexadecimal and
			choose the base64 representation</p>
		<H4>signature values ​​</h4>
		<p>A SPHINCS + signature consists of 3 parts that are in the
			graphical interface.</p>
		<p>These values ​​are the random value "R", the signature part den
			FORS generated and the signature part generated from the hypertree
			is.</p>

		<h3 id="hypertree">SPHINCS + Hypertree</h3>
		<p>In the upper section is a description and a dynamic text field.
			The dynamic text box adapts, depending after which element in the
			underlying representation was selected.
		<P>
		<p>The graphical representation should show a tree in which every
			node (except the root) represents a tree again. The XMSS trees are
			displayed as an orange, fold-out box. The Root node (public key) of
			each XMSS tree is included used as a node of the hypertree. </ p>
		<p>The leaves of Hypertree are FORS trees. Click on it If you jump
			one tab on the fourth tab of the plugin.</p>

		<h3 id="forest">SPHINCS + FORS</h3>
		<p>The public key of the FORS tree is called a leaf in the
			Hypertree used. The FORS tree again consists of subtrees. These
			subtrees are displayed as a drop-down item. there the root and the
			container element are marked in green - they represent the same
			element</p>

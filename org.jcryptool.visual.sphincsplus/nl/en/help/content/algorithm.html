<title>The SPHINCS+ signature scheme</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>SPHINCS+</h1>
	The documentation is divided into three parts:
	</p>
	<li><a href="index.html">plugin description </a></li>
	<li><a href="algorithm.html">Algorithm </a></li>
	<li><a href="ablauf.html">the process </a></li>
	</ul>

	<p>The SPHINCS+ method consists of several algorithms. These are
		explained here first and then follows the process and the Relationship
		between the elements.</P>

	<H2>FORS</h2>
	<p>FORS is the abbreviation for "Forest of random subsets". FORS is
		a "few-times signature scheme". It's an improvement from HORST, which
		is a variant of HORS. For the safety of FORS it is It is important
		that the call parameter be the output of a hash function is.</p>
	<h3>Parameters used</h3>
	<Ul>
		<li>n: defines the length of the secret and public Key, number of
			bytes in a signature element.</Li>
		<li>k: number of secret key groups, trees and indexes which are
			calculated from the input string.</li>
		<li>t: number of elements per secret key group, number the leaves
			per hash tree and the upper limit of the calculated Index value. The
			parameter must be a multiple of 2.</Li>
	</Ul>



	<P>
		FORS uses the parameters k and t (t = 2 <sup>a</sup>). It signs the
		Strings of length k * a.
	</P>
	<p>The secret key consists of k * t random strings the byte length
		n. The keys are in k groups each with t Grouped elements. The
		character strings become pseudorandom from Generated secret key
		SK.seed.</p>
	<p>A public FORS key is a hash of length n is calculated from a
		hash of the root nodes of the k binary trees.</p>
	<p>Each of the binary trees has a height a and is used by t to
		authenticate secret keys of the k groups.</p>
	<P>
	<h3>FORS signature</h3>
	<p>A FORS signature consists of k secret key elements and the
		authentication path.
	<P>
	<P>
		To compute a FORS signature, the message hash (md, message digest) is
		divided into k bit strings of length a. This is too Note that a is the
		number of bits! The bit strings then become interpreted as a number
		between 0 and t-1. <br> To a secret To obtain keys, the sets are
		sequentially selected and the sets become the secret key with the
		calculated index selected.
	</P>
	<p>The authentication path is calculated by always using the
		opposite node is selected.</p>

	<img src="../img/auth_path.png" width=30% alt="Authentifizierungspfad">

	<h4>FORS TreeHash</h4>
	<p>The parameters used are:</p>
	<Ul>
		<li>SK.seed, the secret main initialization vector</li>
		<li>s, the start index</li>
		<li>z, the height of the destination node</li>
		<li>PK.seed, the main public initialization vector</li>
		<li>adrs, the address of the tree</li>
	</Ul>

	<P>
		FORS-TreeHash describes the calculation of the nodes with the length
		n. The function works much like the TreeHash function of the Merkle
		tree. It is assumed that 2% 2 <sup>z</sup> = 0, since otherwise the
		Treehash algorithm would calculate nodes which are not in the tree.
	<h4>FORS signature generation</h4>
	<P>
		A FORS signature consists of k parts, with each part being a secret
		Key is n bytes and the associated authentication path with ld (t) * n
		bytes. <br> You can unlock the key generation split several
		steps:
	</p>
	<Ol>
		<li>For each signature element:</li>
		<Ol>
			<li>Calculate the next index (t bits from the message hash are
				interpreted as a number)</li>
			<li>Choose a secret key</li>
			<li>Calculate the authentication path (call the TreeHash
				function)</li>
			<li>Append the key and path to the FORS signature</li>
		</Ol>
		<li>Return the entire FORS signature</li>
	</Ol>
	<p>A signature has the following scheme:</p>
	<table border=1>
		<tr>
			<td>Private key value (tree 0) (n bytes)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Authentication path (tree 0) (log t * n bytes)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>. . .</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Private key value (tree k-1) (n bytes)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Authentication path (tree k-1) (log t*n bytes)</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<h4>FORS verification</h4>
	<p>In SPHINCS + the signature is implicitly compared. A FORS
		signature is used to assign a public FORS key to calculate. This key
		will then be used in further calculation of the XMSS tree used and
		thus implicitly compared. So there is no function "fors_verify"
		(direct counterpart to "fors_sign"), but only "fors_pkFromSig".</p>
	<p>The function takes the following parameters:</p>
	<Ul>
		<li>message M, a k * ld (t) long bit string</li>
		<li>SIG <sub> FORS </sub>, a FORS signature
		</Li>
		<li>PK.seed, the main public initialization vector</li>
		<li>adrs, the address of the tree. Describes the position of FORS
			instance in the SPHINCS + virtual structure.</Li>
	</Ul>
	<P>
		First, the roots of the k binary trees using Treehash calculated.
		After that, the roots are made using the customizable Hash function T
		<sub> k </sub> hashed.
	</P>
	<p>The algorithm has the following scheme:</p>
	<Ol>
		<li>For each signature element</li>
		<Ol>
			<li>Calculate the next index (t bits from the message hash are
				interpreted as a number)</li>
			<li>Calculate the sheet</li>
			<li>Calculate the root from the leaf and the Authentication path
			</li>
		</Ol>
		<li>Create the public key and give it back</li>
	</Ol>


	<H3>
		WOTS <sup> + </sup> one-time signatures
	</H3>
	<p>WOTS + describes a procedure for any message sign. The private
		key may only be signed once be used. If a key is used twice, it will
		Procedure uncertain.</P>
	<p>WOTS + uses the following parameters:</p>
	<Ul>
		<li>n: The security parameter describes the message length as
			well as the length of the private key, the public Key and signature
			elements in bytes.</Li>
		<li>w: The winternitz parameter is an element of the list {4, 16,
			256}. A larger value means smaller signatures, however slower
			operations.</li>
	</Ul>
	<P>
		The number of elements in a WOTS + signature, a public one Key and a
		private key can be expressed by the following formula calculate: len =
		len <sub> 1 </sub> + len <sub> 2 </sub>. len <sub> 1 </sub> = ceil (n
		/ log (w)) <br> len <sub> 2 </sub> = floor (ld (len <sub> 1
		</sub> (w-1)) / ld (w)) + 1 <br>
	</P>
	<H4>
		WOTS <sup> + </sup> chain function
	</H4>
	<p>The WOTS + chain function calculates an iteration of the Hash
		function F over the n-byte input string under the Using ADRS and
		PK.seed.</P>
	<p>The parameters used are:</p>
	<Ul>
		<li>X, the input string</li>
		<li>i, the start index</li>
		<li>s, the number of steps</li>
		<li>PK.seed, the public initialization vector</li>
		<li>ADRS, seven fields each with 32-bit words around the address
			to be able to contain the chain</li>
	</Ul>

	<P>Run:</p>
	<Ol>
		<li>Check if S == 0, if yes, return X</li>
		<li>Check if (i + s)> (w-1), if yes, return NULL</li>
		<li>Recursive call of the function, with the same parameters,
			except s-1. Save the return value in tmp.</Li>
		<li>set the hash address to i + s-1</li>
		<li>Return the hash of (PK.seed, ADRS, tmp);
	</Ol>

	<H4>
		WOTS <sup> + </sup> Sign
	</H4>
	<P>
		A WOTS + signature is an array of length len, with each one Field is a
		string of length n bytes. The signature is generated by converting the
		message into numbers from 0 to w-1 becomes. Then the base of the
		numbers is changed to w (length len <sub> 1 </sub>). A checksum over M
		is calculated and also based on w converted (length len <sub> 2
		</sub>). The checksum can be a maximum Achieve value of len <sub> 1 </sub> *
		(w-1) * 2 <sup> 8 </sup>. <br> Each the numbers to the base w are
		used around a node of one to use another hash chain. The signature
		arises from the Joining the different nodes. The parameters are the
		Message M, SK.seed, PK.seed, ADRS.
	</P>

	<P>Run</p>
	<Ol>
		<li>Convert message to base w</li>
		<li>Calculate checksum</li>
		<li>Convert the checksum to the base w</li>
		<li>len times the following steps:</li>
		<Ol>
			<li>Set the chain address</li>
			<li>Calling the chain function with the hash of SK.seed and
				ADRS, 0, message at current position, PK.seed and ADRS. Append
				result to the current position of the signature.</Li>
		</Ol>
		<li>Return the signature</li>
	</Ol>


	<h4 id="wotspkFromSig">
		WOTS <sup> + </sup> verification
	</H4>
	<p>Like FORS, there is no direct function to Verify WOTS +
		signatures. There is only one function, which extracted the public key
		from a signature, which then is implicitly verified.</p>
	<p>The calculation starts with the calculation of the remaining
		chain, starting with the values ​​at the base of the message hash and
		the Checksum. These values ​​are in the signature. In SPHINCS + the
		Verify the calculated key using the calculation of the public SPHINCS
		+ key.</p>
	<p>The following parameters are used:</p>
	<Ul>
		<li>sig, the WOTS + signature</li>
		<li>M, the message</li>
		<Li>PK.seed</li>
		<Li>ADRS</li>
	</Ul>
	<p>The process of calculating the public key is the same like the
		creation of a signature. The only difference is that not the signature
		itself is returned, but the generated one public keys. The key is
		called by calling a Hash function with the parameters PK.seed, the
		address of the public Key generated by WOTS + and the output of the
		chain function.</P>


	<H3>XMSS</h3>
	<P>
		XMSS stands for "eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme", which is the WOTS
		+ is connected to a binary hash tree. It becomes 2 <sup> h '</sup>
		WOTS <sup> + </sup> public keys authenticated by means of the Binary
		tree that has a height of h '. So everyone can XMSS key pair of height
		h 'to be used for 2 <sup> h' </sup> sign different messages.
	</P>
	<p>An XMSS signature contains the WOTS + signature from the message
		and the authentication path. The path is a vector of nodes, which at
		verification, calculating the root, starting from the WOTS +
		signature, allowed.</p>
	<p>XMSS uses the following parameters:</p>
	<Ul>
		<li>h ': the height (d-1) of the tree</li>
		<li>n: the message and node length</li>
		<li>w: the winternet parameter</li>
	</Ul>
	<p>In SPHINCS +, a secret XMSS key is the SK.seed, which contained
		in the secret SPHINCS + key. He is used around to generate a secret
		WOTS + key.</p>
	<H4>Treehash</h4>
	<p>For the calculation of the internal nodes of the Merkle tree,
		which n bytes long, the treehash function is used. The used parameters
		are:</p>
	<Ul>
		<Li>SK.seed</li>
		<Li>PK.seed</li>
		<li>s, the start index. Starting at the leaf of the tree, and
			starts with 0.</li>
		<li>z, the height of the destination node</li>
		<li>ADRS, the address of the tree</li>
	</Ul>
	<p>The algorithm returns the root of a tree with height z back,
		where the leaf, which is on the left, the public WOTS + key with the
		index s.</p>
	<P>
		A prerequisite for this algorithm is that s% 2 <sup> z </sup> = 0
		otherwise, the algorithm would become non-existent nodes to calculate.
		The algorithm has the following sequence:
	</P>
	<Ol>
		<li>Check if s% 2 <sup> z </sup> = 0, otherwise abort
		</Li>
		<li>For each index i, until 2 <sup> z </sup>:
			<Ol>
				<li>Set the address of the WOTS hash</li>
				<li>Calculate a node by computing a public one WOTS key</li>
				<li>Set tree height and tree index</li>
				<li>For each node on the stack that has the same height as the
					calculated node:</li>
				<Ol>
					<li>Set the index of the tree</li>
					<li>Calculate the new node by hovering the Concatenation of
						the node on the stack with the previously calculated Node</li>
					<li>Set the height of the tree</li>
				</Ol>
				<li>Add stack to recalculated node</li>
			</Ol>
		<li>Return the node</li>
	</Ol>

	<h4>Generate a public XMSS key</h4>
	<p>In the context of SPHINCS +, a public XMSS key is the Root of
		the binary hash tree. The root is using the Treehash algorithm
		'calculated. The generation of the public Key is just a treehash call.
	</p>
	<P>
	<p>Treehash is called with the following parameters: SK.seed, s =
		0, z = h ', PK.seed, ADRS.</P>
	<h4>The XMSS signature</h4>
	<p>A signature is a byte string of length (len + h ') * n. He
		consists of a WOTS + signature with length len * n bytes, and the
		Authentication path for the sheet used for the WOTS + Key pair was
		used, with the length h '* n bytes. The signature So it looks like
		this:</p>
	<table border=1>
		<Tr>
			<td>sig (len * n bytes)</td>
		<Tr>
			<td>AUTH [0] (n bytes)</td>
		</Tr>
		<Tr>
			<Td>...</td>
		</Tr>
		<Tr>
			<td>AUTH [h-1] (n bytes)</td>
		</Tr>
	</Table>

	<h4>Signing with XMSS</h4>
	<p>For signing, first a WOTS + signature is sent over the Message
		hash calculated. This will be the WOTS key at the Position idx used.
		Then the authentication path becomes calculated. This can somehow be
		calculated; it will be in the Reference implementation uses the
		Treehash algorithm.</P>
	<p>The following parameters are required:</p>
	<Ul>
		<li>M, n-byte long message</li>
		<Li>SK.seed</li>
		<li>idx, the index of the WOTS + key pair</li>
		<li>ADRS, the address of the XMSS instance</li>
	</Ul>
	<p>Signing consists only of the 3 steps:</p>
	<Ol>
		<li>Create the authentication path</li>
		<li>Calling WOTS_SIGN</li>
		<li>Returning the concatination of the signature and the
			Authentication path.</Li>
	</Ol>

	<h4>Implicit Verification</h4>
	<P>As with other methods in the SPHINCS + scheme, XMSS only becomes
		implicitly verified. One calculates only the one when verifying public
		XMSS key (root of the tree). This will then be in Another sequence
		used to be implicitly compared The function uses the following
		parameters:</P>
	<Ul>
		<li>idx, the index of the signature</li>
		<li>SIG_XMSS, the XMSS signature SIG <sub> XMSS </sub>
		</li>
		<li>M, the message with the length n bytes</li>
		<Li>PK.seed</li>
		<li>ADRS, the address of the current XMSS instance</li>
	</Ul>
	<p>The process looks something like this</p>
	<Ol>
		<li>Calculate the public key of WOTS + from the WOTS + Signature
			using <a href="#wotspkFromSig"> wots_pkFromSig () </a> and save in
			node [0]
		</Li>
		<li>Calculate the root using the public WOTS + key and the
			authentication path</li>
		<Ol>
			<li>Set the address</li>
			<li>Hashen the node and the current authentication path</li>
		</Ol>
		<li>Return the node</li>
	</Ol>


	<H3>
		The SPHINCS <sup> + </sup> Hypertree
	</H3>
	<P>
		The SPHINCS + Hypertree is a variant of XMSS <sup> MT </sup>. It is a
		certification tree of XMSS instances. In this tree will always the
		overlying node uses the underlying node to sign. Each node, except the
		lowest level, is the public key of the XMSS tree. The lowest level
		(the Leaves of the hypertree) are used around the actual message to
		sign. These nodes are the public keys of FORS.
	<P>
	<p>The graphic illustration shows the structure of the hypertree.
		The blue triangles represent the nodes of the HT, which are the public
		ones Are keys of the underlying XMSS tree.</P>
	<img src="../ img / HT.png" alt="Graphic illustration of hypertree">

	<h4>Hypertree Key Generation</h4>
	<p>The secret key of the Hypertree is the SK.seed, which is used to
		generate all secret keys of WOTS +. The Hypertree public key is the
		public key of the XMSS tree, which is located at the root of the
		hypertree. When Parameter for the key generation becomes only the
		secret Initialization vector SK.seed and public vector PK.seed used.
		The function is a call to xmss_PKgen with the 2 Parameters and the
		root address.</P>

	<h4>Hypertree Signature</h4>
	<P>
		A signature SIG <sub> HT </sub> is a string of length (H + d * len) *
		n. It consists of the XMSS signatures, each with the length (h / d +
		len) * n bytes.
	</P>

	<h4>Hypertree signature generation</h4>
	<p>A hypertree signature requires the following call parameters:</p>
	<Ul>
		<li>M, the message</li>
		<Li>SK.seed</li>
		<Li>PK.seed</li>
		<li>idx, the index of the leaf used in hypertree will sign the
			message</li>
	</Ul>
	<p>A hypertree signature consists of the following parts:</p>
	<table border=1>
		<Tr>
			<td>XMSS Signature SIG <sub> XMSS </sub> (layer 0) ((h / d +
				len) * n bytes)
			</Td>
		</Tr>
		<Tr>
			<td>XMSS Signature SIG <sub> XMSS </sub> (layer 1) ((h / d +
				len) * n bytes)
			</Td>
		</Tr>
		<Tr>
			<Td>. , .</Td>
		</Tr>
		<Tr>
			<td>XMSS Signature SIG <sub> XMSS </sub> (layer d-1) ((h / d +
				len) * n bytes)
			</Td>
		</Tr>
	</Table>
	<p>A signature is generated by the signing function of XMSS is
		called. The exact calculation is in the NIST submission under chapter
		4.2.4.</p>

	<h4>Hypertree Verification</h4>
	<p>A signature verification consists of the calls to XMSS, the
		returns the secret key from a signature, and a Comparison with a given
		value. The process is up to the last Step equal to signing:</p>
	<Ol>
		<li>Sign the first node (root)</li>
		<li>For each of the d-1 nodes:</li>
		<Ol>
			<li>Compute the secret XMSS key of the node</li>
			<li>Sign the next node with the current</li>
			<li>Set the next node as current</li>
		</Ol>
		<li>If the last node is equal to the public key of the
			Hypertrees, then the signature is verified correctly.</Li>
	</Ol>


	<H3>SPHINCS +</h3>
	<h4>SPHINCS + parameter</h4>
	<P>
		The effects of the parameters have already been described in <a
			href="index.html # parameter"> the parameter overview </a> explained.
	</P>
	<h4>The SPHINCS + key generation</h4>
	<p>The secret key of SPHINCS + consists of 2 parts. a n-byte long
		SK.seed, which is used for all secret Generate WOTS + and FORS keys,
		and a randomly generated one Value SK.prf used to deterministic random
		To compute message hash.</P>
	<p>The keys SK.seed, SK.prf and PK.seed are called by call
		generated a secure random number generator, each one n-byte long
		random number returns. The key PK.root is, through Call the Hypertree
		function to generate the secret HT key, generate.
	<P>
	<h4>The SPHINCS + signature</h4>
	<p>The signature of SPHINCS + has a length of (1 + k * (a + 1) + h
		+ d * len) * n bytes. It consists of 3 parts:</p>
	<Ul>
		<li>A random value R (n bytes)</li>
		<li>A FORS signature SIG <sub> FORS </sub> (k * (a + 1) * n
			bytes)
		</Li>
		<li>A hypertree signature SIG <sub> HT </sub> ((h + d * len) * n
			bytes)
		</Li>
	</Ul>

	<h4>SPHINCS + Signature Generation</h4>
	<p>The generation consists of 4 steps:</p>
	<Ol>
		<li>The value R is generated pseudorandomly.</li>
		<li>This value is used to hash the message which converts into a
			submessages, a tree index and a Sheet index is divided.</Li>
		<li>These 3 parts become the actual necessary bits extracted</li>
		<li>The partial partial message is then used with the FORS key
			pair at the location idx_leaf, in the XMSS tree at the Place idx_tree
			in the lowest HT level, signed. The FORS key is then signed using
			Hypertree.</Li>
	</Ol>
	<p>The exact lengths of the computed fields are in the NIST
		submission in Chapter 6.4</p>

	<h4>SPHINCS + verification</h4>
	<p>During verification, the message hash is recalculated Message
		hash just like when signing again divided and one calculated
		appropriate FORS key. Instead of the FORS key then By signing the
		hypertree, the FORS key is linked to the Hypertree verified. The
		verification function of the hypertree called.</p>

	<h4>SPHINCS + Parameter Sets</h4>
	<p>In SPHINCS + there are predefined parameter sets that are very
		for many applications provide good default settings. There is always
		an f-variant, which is for speed is designed, and a s-variant, which
		is for a small signature is designed.</p>

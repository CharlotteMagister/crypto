Constants_125=This Plug-in demonstrates Simple Power Analysis attack against RSA-encryption.\n\"Square and Multiply\" mode: if the current digit is a '0', only a squaring operation will be carried out, while the current digit is a '1', besides the squaring, a multiplication operation will be executed after each squaring. Obviously shown in the diagram above, the power traces between squaring and multiplication operations are quite different. In the decryption process according to the power traces we can distinguish every bit of private key is a binary '0' or a '1'.\n\nIf the whole secret key digits can be read from the power traces, the RSA is vulnerable. Of course, it should be mentioned that in fact the secret key of RSA is at least 1024 bit long and to ensure the security, it is recommended that n be at least 2048 bits long. However, no matter how long the secret key is, if the power traces of some key operations are obviously distinct, the RSA based cryptograhic system is insecure and weak.

Constants_132=This Plug-in demonstrates Simple Power Analysis attack against RSA-encryption.\n\"Square and Multiply Always\" mode: the squaring and multiplication operations will be constantly executed in each loop, so it is difficult to read out the private key with SPA.\r\nAvoiding these types of conditional statements when implementing these algorithms can eliminate many SPA weaknesses. In algorithms which inherently assume this type of key dependent branching, it may not be possible to remove these statements completely. However, operations with large power characteristics ( e.g. multiplications ) can be moved outside of conditional branches to decrease the size of SPA characteristics. This strategy can be applied to the square-and-multiply algorithm as shown above. \r\nTechniques for resisting power analysis can be implemented at both the hardware and software levels. Countermeasures at the software level seem to be more desirable, from a commercial standpoint at least, since they can be implemented on existing architectures. However countermeasures in software level are always based on sacrifice of the execution performance and the algorithm efficiency. The Hardware countermeasures are generally more costly to implement, but they may be necessary depending on the required level of security.

SPAView_description=In cryptography, power analysis is a form of side channel attack in which the attacker studies the power consumption of a cryptographic hardware device (such as a smart card, tamper-resistant "black box", or integrated circuit). The attack can non-invasively extract cryptographic keys and other secret information from the device. Simple power analysis (SPA) involves visually interpreting power traces, or graphs of electrical activity over time.

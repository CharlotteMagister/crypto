MerkleTreeKey_1=Please generate a key pair to proceed.
MerkleTreeKey_2=Key length:
MerkleTreeKey_3=The tabs "MerkleTree" and "Key Pair" provide additional information about the scheme.\r\nIn the tabs "Signature generation" and "Verification" you can create and verify your own signatures.  

MerkleTreeKey_column_0=Key Number
MerkleTreeKey_column_1=Private Key
MerkleTreeKey_column_2=Public Key
MerkleTreeKey_Message=The key pairs where generated successfully!

MerkleTreeSign_0=Enter a message
MerkleTreeSign_1=This is an example text which is to be signed.\r\nYou can enter a message of your own choice.
MerkleTreeSign_2=Sign Message
MerkleTreeSign_4=Signature length
MerkleTreeSign_5=highlight signature part:
MerkleTreeSign_6_1=Index
MerkleTreeSign_6_2=Index/Seed
MerkleTreeSign_7=One-time signature
MerkleTreeSign_8_1=Authentication path
MerkleTreeSign_8_2=Reduced XMSS signature: one-time signature and authentication path
MerkleTreeSign_9=There are no more one-time keys left. Generate a new key pair!

MerkleTreeVerify_4=Explanation
MerkleTreeVerify_5=Created Signatures
MerkleTreeVerify_6=Verify
MerkleTreeVerify_7=The verification of the signature with the chosen node was successful.
MerkleTreeVerify_8=The signature couldn't be verified successfully!
MerkleTreeVerify_9=Please click Verify to check the chosen node.
MerkleTreeVerify_10=Path from root to the chosen node:
MerkleTreeVerify_11=This is the correct path.
MerkleTreeVerify_12=This is an incorrect path.
MerkleTreeVerify_13=Please choose a leaf to verify the signature. A node can`t be used to verify the signature!

MerkleTree_Signature_Generation_Info=Please create a signature in the fourth tab first. After you created a signature, it can be verified in this tab. 

UnsavedChanges=Unsaved changes. Do you want to save the changes?


Tab0_Head1=Seed
Tab0_Head2=Generate key pair
Tab0_Head5=Winternitz parameter
Tab0_Head6=Parameter

Tab0_Seed0=Private Seed
Tab0_Seed1=Public Seed
Tab0_Seed2=Generate public seed
Tab0_Seed3=Generate private seed

Tab0_Txt3=The Bitmask is one of the main differences to the Merkle signature scheme. The Bitmask is a pseudorandom choosen binary value. Here you can enter the seed for the pseudorandom generator that generates the Bitmask.

Tab0_Button0=Generate new seed
Tab0_Button1=Generate new bitmask seed

Tab0_MT_1=Treeheight 2; 15 Trees
Tab0_MT_2=Treeheight 3; 5 Trees

Tab0_MT_4=Treeheight 3; 21 Trees
Tab0_MT_5=Treeheight 4; 9 Trees

Tab1_Button_1=Hide description
Tab1_Button_2=Show description

Tab0_Lable1=Number of one-time signatures

InteractiveSignature_Button_0=Interactive signature generation
InteractiveSignature_Button_1=Back
InteractiveSignature_Button_2=Next
InteractiveSignature_Button_3=New signature
InteractiveSignature_Button_4=Go to verification tab
InteractiveSignature_Button_5=Simple signature generation
InteractiveSignature_1=Welcome to the interactive signature generation.\nPlease enter a message.
InteractiveSignature_2=First we search for a free one-time keypair.
InteractiveSignature_3_1=Here, Leaf
InteractiveSignature_3_2=wasn't used before. We write down the leaf's index.
InteractiveSignature_4_1=Your entered message is signed by the one-time signature key pair with index
InteractiveSignature_4_2=. The one-time signature is then added to the main signature. 
InteractiveSignature_5=We need more information to hash the tree. The values from the red marked nodes are important for the verifier and need to be supplemented. That is the authentication path.
InteractiveSignature_6=The signature is finished as soon as all needed nodes are supplemented. The signature can be verified in the Tab \"Verify\".
InteractiveSignature_6_MT=The signature is finished as soon as all reduced XMSS signatures are added. The signature can be verified in the Tab \"Verify\".
InteractiveSignature_7=Current Index:
InteractiveSignature_8=In this tab you can create signatures. Choose one of the following two options. The only difference between these options is the display of the signature.
InteractiveSignature_9=With the Interactive Signature Generator you can follow the signature generation process step by step.
InteractiveSignature_10=Generate a signature.
InteractiveSignature_11=Signature length:
InteractiveSignature_12=This single tree (highlighted by color) has its own reduced XMSS signature. Reduced means, it contains no index or seed, as this information is already part of the main MultiTree signature. The amount of reduced XMSS signatures chained together in a MultiTree signature depends on the tree height you chose at creating the key. In this case it is
InteractiveSignature_abort_1=Warning
InteractiveSignature_abort_2=Do you want to abort the signature generation?
InteractiveSignature_Seed=The next part is a random seed, which is needed to calculate the hash values.

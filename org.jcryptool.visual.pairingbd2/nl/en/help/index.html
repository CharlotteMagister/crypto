  <h2 id="scheme-general">1) Multi-Partite Key Exchange (MPKE) Algorithms</h2>
  
  <p>Multi-party or multi-partite key agreement (MPKA) [other names used are group key exchange (<b>GKE</b>) protocols or conference key establishment protocols] are methods to securely exchange information over an unsecure/public channel in order to agree on a common cryptographic key between more than 2 parties. The first scheme of this kind was the <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.jcryptool.visual.ecdh/$nl$/help/content/index.html">Diffie-Hellman key exchange (<b>DH</b>)</a> which described this protocol for 2 parties.</p>
  
  <p>Multi-partite key agreement protocols are part of the research area of secure multi-party computation (<b>MPC</b>) and these protocols are relevant e.g. for mobile phones or 3G, 4G, or 5G.</p>
  
  <p>Here we consider only such multi-partite key agreement protocols which do not require any trusted third party. The original Diffie-Hellman key exchange (DHKE) was originally implemented only in finite fields of prime order. However, also other cryptographic primitives can be used namely elliptic curves and pairings on elliptic curves.</p>
  
  <p>This visualization shows for an arbitrary number of users the BD II key exchange protocol (named after its inventors <b>B</b>urmester and <b>D</b>esmedt), presented in the pairings from Weil and Tate for a small degree and xx-pairings for a higher, more secure degree. More details can be found in [Onete 2008].</p>

Also the DH key exchange protocol can be operated with more than two parties but there is a lot of overhead then. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange]

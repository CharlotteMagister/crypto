#Model
ModelComposite_description = This visualization shows how the usage of different validity models (Shell- and Chain model) affects the validity of certificates. Please note that these models are not related to the signature verification per se and that this user interface only serves learning purposes. \r\n\r\nThe button "Recalculate" will be deactivated if the given date is invalid. In addition, you can restore the default certificates by clicking on the button "Back".
ModelComposite_lblHeader = Validity models
ModelComposite_lblTitle = Validity models
ModelComposite_lbllevel2 = Level 2 certificate
ModelComposite_lbllevel3 = User certificate
ModelComposite_lblroot = Root certificate
SigVerComposite_MessageTitleReturn = Information
SigVerComposite_btnAddInput = Choose input
SigVerComposite_btnDecrypt = Verify signature

SigVerComposite_btnHash = Choose hash method
SigVerComposite_btnReset = Step back
SigVerComposite_btnResult = Show result
SigVerComposite_btnReturn = Return to JCT-PKI
SigVerComposite_btnSignature = Verify signature
SigVerComposite_description = This visualization shows how to verify a digital signature for a chosen document. A digital signature is used to check authenticity and integrity of a message.
SigVerComposite_lblHeader = Signature Verification
SigVerComposite_lblProgress = Step %s of 4
SigVerComposite_lblPubKey = Public Key
SigVerComposite_lblTitle = Signature Verification
SigVerComposite_menu = Select all

SigVerComposite_txtDescriptionOfStep1 = Choose input\r\n\r\nYou can choose which document you want to verify. The document has to be created using the "Signature Demonstration". To start the signature verification please click on the button "Choose input". Follow the instructions afterwards.
SigVerComposite_txtDescriptionOfStep2 = Choose hash method\r\n\r\nInformation: This step is normally not needed for a verification. It's only included out of necessity to insure compatibility with the "Signature Demonstration". Usually, the signature contains information about how it was created. \r\nA hash method is an algorithm that converts a data set of variable length to a data set of fixed length. In practice, the hash value is signed, because the hash value of a message (e.g. a file) usually is much shorter than the message itself. In order to verify the signature, you calculate the hash value of the received message, which will be compared to the received hash value of the message.\r\nPlease select the algorithm that was used to create the signature.
SigVerComposite_txtDescriptionOfStep3 = Verify result\r\n\r\n"Open" the received signature. This opening process reverts the signing, and it depends on the used signature algorithm. To create a signature the private key of the sender is used; to open the signature the public key is used. What you get during this "opning" process is the original hash value which you can then compare with the one you just calculated.
SigVerComposite_txtDescriptionOfStep4 = Show result\r\n\r\nThe signature helps to insure the authenticity of the sender and that there was nothing changed within the document. If the verification succeeded, you will see a green tick. If not, you will see a red cross. For more information, please click on "Show result".
